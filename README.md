# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Build a Neural Network from scratch)

## Introduction:
In this project, I built a neural network without framework such as Tensorflow or Pytorch to carry out a prediction on a real world problem! By constructing a neural network from scratch, I can have better understanding of the mechanism of NN, for example backpropagation, gradient descent and other important concepts. 

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

## Discussion adn Observation:

1. In the bike-sharing problem, NN may not be the best choice since some features can be noisy and messy, they can influence the accuracy a lot. At the same, some simple solution like random forest may be more resistant to those noise.

2.EDA and feature selection are needed for further improvement.
